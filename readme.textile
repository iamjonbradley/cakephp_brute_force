h1. Brute Force Detection Plugin

Simple brute force login detector

h2. Background

While developing an application we were getting 1000s of brute force attacks so 
we decided to create a plugin to handle detection of this to block the users.

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.3+
* CakePHP 1.3
* Minor intelligence

h2. Get The Source

_[Manual]_

# Download this: http://github.com/jonbradley/Brute-Force-Detection/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to app/plugins
# Rename the folder you just copied to @intrusion

_[GIT Clone]_

* In your plugin directory type
 <pre><code>git clone git@github.com:jonbradley/Brute-Force-Detection.git brute_force</code></pre>


h2. Installation

* Import the database schema
  <pre><code>./cake/console/cake schema -plugin brute_force_ create</code></pre>

* Rename and update the config in detect/config/settings.php:

* Include the detect component in your app_controller.php:
  <pre><code>public $components = array('BruteForce.Detect');</code></pre>

* Add the following to your beforeFilter
  <pre><code>$this->set('blocked', $this->Detect->checkForPenalty());</code></pre>

Now you can call $blocked anywhere you wish in your views

h2. Options

# max_penalty : time in seconds of the penalty
# max_attempts : max number of attempts until the user is blocked
# look_back : amount of time to look back to block a user
# notify : email to nofiy of the block

h2. Todo

* Add new features, and no I have no clue what they should be right now
